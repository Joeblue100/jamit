            <h1>Why Jamit</h1>
            <br>
            <p>We saw the need for a platform that will at all times showcase and celebrate the voices of people of color (and not just in a specific month of the year). A place where users can express themselves authentically and get their stories to everyone who would love to hear it and also give a new way for others to learn about other cultures.
                It our mission to bring the next generation of diverse storytellers to the social audio scene.
